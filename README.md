🛸 🪐 Welcome to my personal project page! 🛸 🪐



Out of the hundreds of thousands of developers, I'm happy you made it to this corner of the web.

## About me

I'm a lifelong learner and chaser of cool and complicated things!

Starting out as a biology nerd, I ended up in the tech world due to some crazy [circumstances](lifestory.md) but I am happy life turned out this way.

🚀🚀 Thanks for checking out my project page 🚀🚀
